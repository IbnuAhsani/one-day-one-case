## About

This is a repository for solutions to competitive programming problems from multiple technical assessment platforms, such as Hackerrank and Codilitiy.

Feel free to contribute towards this repo by submitting your solutions (written in any language) to a given problem through pull requests. Make sure that the name of the problem as well as the url for that website is listed clearly.

Hope this repo could benefit programmers who strive to become better problem solvers.

## How to Contribute

- Create a new folder in the root directory, with the folder name being the name of the problem written in kebab-case.
- Place the solution file for that problem inside the new folder and name the file `Solution.file_extension`.
- Don't forget to add a new entry to the [README.md](https://github.com/IbnuAhsani/one-day-one-case/blob/master/README.md) for the newly submitted contribution so that it would be easy to keep track of all the problems that've been solved.
